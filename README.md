This repository contains code exercises and examples I completed as part of Udacity's [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) program. 

The notebooks in this repository demonstrate various computer vision applications and techniques, including: 

1. [Image Representation](1_1_Image_Representation)
2. [Convolutional Filters and Edge Detection](1_2_Convolutional_Filters_Edge_Detection)
3. [Types of Features and Image Segmentation](1_3_Types_of_Features_Image_Segmentation)
4. [Feature Vectors](1_4_Feature_Vectors)
5. [CNN Layers](1_5_CNN_Layers)
6. [YOLO](2_2_YOLO)
